Thijs and ??? will work on this project for 3.5 hours a week on monday mornings (9:00 - 11:00) and thursday afternoon (15:00 - 16:30). I will skype with them every thursday afternoon to discuss the project.

The project will run till the summer holiday and will have 2 phases, phase 1 needs to be completed by the first week of april:

phase 1: detail the assignment 
phase 2: building the aquaponics setup

Initially we want to document what is already out there in terms of projects so these guys can come up with something new and dont have to reinvent the wheel:

- what project already exist, what are their limitations?
- The idea sounds great for a in house cultivation. But, just brain exercise, how hard would be to upscale the prototype in case we wanna have a community garden? 

If you feel like helping to flesh out the assignment, please contribute! English contributions can be translated.

Supervisors:
Winand (Coordination)
Victor (github, documentation and assignment specifics)
Claudio (advoce)
new volunteers (details coming soon)
