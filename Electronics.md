###Microcontroller
Some kind of Arduino

###Soil moisture sensor
[This one seems to be common](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/soil-moisture-sensor-hookup-guide?_ga=1.194403118.227000660.1460965868)

###Water pump and valves
To deliver the right ammount of water (and nutrient solution?) to the right plants.

###LED grow lights
Maybe try and make our own white LED light strip. Keep [photosynthetically active radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosynthetically_active_radiation) in mind.

###pH sensor
Can be usefull for some plants

###Feedback
To know how your plants are doing

###GUI
To control the system

###Real Time Clock
It will need to keep track of time
